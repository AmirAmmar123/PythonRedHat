Breakpoints

Developers can use breakpoints to stop the debugger on specific points in the code.

    You can use the break command to set a breakpoint.

        The short version of the break command is b.

    The continue command automatically continues the program execution until the next breakpoint. You can use it instead of the step or next commands.

The following example sets a breakpoint on line 7 of the source code (total += value), and uses the continue command to jump to the next breakpoint.

$ python3
Python 3.9.10 (main, Feb 9 2022, 00:00:00)
[GCC 11.2.1 20220127 (Red Hat 11.2.1-9)] on linux

>>> import pdb
>>> import simple_program
>>> pdb.run('simple_program.main()')
> <string>(1)<module>()
(Pdb) step
--Call-
> /home/student/AD141/AD141-apps/debugger/examples/simple_program.py(11)main()
-> def main():
(Pdb) break 7
Breakpoint 1 at
/home/student/AD141/AD141-apps/debugger/examples/simple_program.py:7
(Pdb) continue
> /home/student/AD141/AD141-apps/debugger/examples/simple_program.py(7)sum_args()
-> total += value
(Pdb) continue
> /home/student/AD141/AD141-apps/debugger/examples/simple_program.py(7)sum_args()
-> total += value
(Pdb) continue
8
>>> exit()
$

In the preceding example, the last continue command causes the program to run to completion because there are no more breakpoints defined.
