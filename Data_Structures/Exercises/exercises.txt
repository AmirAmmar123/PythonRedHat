Exercise 1

Write list comprehensions to produce the following lists:

    A list of elements 0,1,2,3,4,â€¦,99

    A list from the preceding comprehension of those values that are evenly divisible by 5.

Exercise 2

Write a list comprehension to create a list of tuples, of x and the factorial of x, for the numbers from 5 to 10 inclusive.

    The math module has a factorial() function that can be used.

Exercise 3

Write a dictionary comprehension that generates a dictionary of numbers and their factorials in the range (1,10).

    Using that dictionary, multiply 6 factorial times 5 factorial.

Exercise 4

Suppose there is a file with three values per line.

    The values are white space separated as follows.

        OwnerName ComputerType ComputerValue 

    Read the lines and make a dictionary of dictionaries so the keys are the owner and the values are a dictionary consisting of the computer type as the key and the computer value as the value.

    Finally, print the dictionary.

    The dataset might look as follows:

Joe Desktop 500
Joe Laptop 200
Joe Desktop 400
Mary Desktop 200
Mary Laptop 800
Beth Laptop 500
Beth Tablet 250
Joe Tablet 250

    The output might look as follows:

{
'Mary': {'Desktop': 200, 'Laptop': 800},
'Beth': {'Tablet': 250, 'Laptop': 500},
'Joe': {'Desktop': 900, 'Tablet': 250, 'Laptop': 200}
}
