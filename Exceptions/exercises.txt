Exercise 1

Create a list in your program that has 10 numbers.

    Then, in a loop, ask the user for a number.

    Use this number as an index into your list and print the value located at that index.

    End the program when the user enters end.

    Handle the case of an illegal number.

    Handle the case of an illegal subscript.

Exercise 2

Test Exercise 1 again by using a few negative numbers as the index.

    Eliminate negative numbers as legitimate subscripts by raising the IndexError exception when a negative number is given.

Exercise 3

Write a program that uses a loop to prompt the user and get an integer value.

    The program should print the sum of all the integers entered.

    If the user enters a blank line or any other line that cannot be converted to an integer, the program should handle this ValueError.

    If the user uses Ctrl+C to terminate the program, then it should be trapped with a KeyboardInterrupt, and a suitable message should be printed.

    When the user enters the end of file character (Ctrl+D on Linux or Ctrl+Z on Windows), the program should trap this with the EOFError, break out of the loop, and print the sum of all the integers.
