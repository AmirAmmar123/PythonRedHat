The seek() method on a file object provides arbitrary random access (seeking forwards or backwards to any location) within the file.

    The syntax for the method is seek(offset[, whence])

    The method changes the stream position to the given byte offset.

    The offset is interpreted relative to the position indicated by the optional parameter whence.

    The os module defines three int constants (SEEK_SET, SET_CUR, and SEEK_END) for the values of whence.

The table below shows the valid values for the whence argument.

    It lists the constant name, the constant value as an int, and the constant meaning.

Table 8.2. whence Argument Values
Constant	Value	Meaning
os.SEEK_SET 	0 	Start of the stream (default). The offset should be zero or positive.
os.SEEK_CUR 	1 	Current stream position. The offset may be negative.
os.SEEK_END 	2 	End of the stream. The offset is usually negative

    Seeking relative to the current position and end position requires an offset of 0 (os.SEEK_SET) when working in text mode.

The tell() method returns the current position as the byte offset from the beginning of the file.

The following example demonstrates the use of the seek() and tell() methods while reading and/or writing files.

    The file read in the example contains the 26 letters of the alphabet.
